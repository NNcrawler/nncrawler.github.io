First martial arts I learned was some form of MMA from my local city. I also like good martial arts movies like IpMan, The Raid, Drunken Master, etc. One thing I observed from martial arts is it’s form. Usually, when you practice martial arts there are forms to practice. You practice the form again and again and again. The main objective is to apply the form in real situation. So that, you can draw the form from your muscle memory."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As a practicioner (WAS. I want to emphasize that I’m out of shape. So please don’t challenge me or beat me up in an alley to take my lunch money), I noticed that detail of the form from one school to another are different. Even if it’s the same style under the same master. This is interesting."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"From that I can draw conclusion that the way martial artist learn is to strictly absorb the style from the teacher. This strict absorbing is because usually modifying when you are under someone is considered to be disrespectful. But after that, the students adapt the style to them. Making it their own. Even adding or modifying the style in order to perfect it for them."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This process of learing can be adapted to the modern world.
