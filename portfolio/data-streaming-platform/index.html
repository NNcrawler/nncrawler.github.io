To make Kafka more accessible and unlock its full potential across the organization, we built a platform called Firehose.</p><p>Firehose simplifies Kafka consumption by exposing events through a familiar interface: HTTP webhooks. Developers can use a self-serve UI to select the Kafka events they want to subscribe to, and Firehose will automatically deliver those events to their configured webhook endpoint. It also handles scaling, monitoring, and lifecycle management out of the box — all self-serve from the UI.</p><p>While Firehose empowers teams to consume events using their own logic, we also built Dagger — a no-code stream processing platform. With Dagger, developers can transform Kafka events using SQL, without writing or deploying custom application code. Dagger powers many critical systems, including supply-demand aggregation for surge pricing, fraud detection, and ad impression pipelines — all through declarative SQL, without the overhead of managing services.</p></div></div></section><section class=portfolio-experience><div class=portfolio-section__header><p class=portfolio-section__eyebrow>Work</p><h2 class=portfolio-section__title>Projects and contributions</h2></div><div class=portfolio-experience__cards><v1-filter-in class=portfolio-experience__filter><div class="card portfolio-work-card" data-filter='{"complexity": "low", "Tech & Tools": ["Java","Apache Flink","Apache Kafka"] }'><span class="portfolio-work-card__badge complexity--low" title="low complexity">〡
