It allowed users to visualize trends, build dashboards, browse a catalog of clickstream events, and trace individual user activity.</p><p>While the platform had some adoption, it suffered from critical issues:</p><ul><li>Trend data was often inaccurate and stale.</li><li>The event catalog was frequently outdated.</li><li>User-level event tracing was extremely slow and frustrating to use.</li><li>The support channel was overwhelmed with complaints and bug reports.</li></ul><p>To address these challenges, I led a full system redesign. After the redesign:</p><ul><li>Data accuracy was significantly improved, restoring trust in reported metrics.</li><li>System latency was reduced from minutes to seconds.</li><li>Data freshness is now near real-time.</li><li>The event catalog is automatically and reliably updated.</li><li>Support requests dropped to nearly zero.</li></ul><p>The result was a much more stable, performant, and trustworthy platform — enabling the product to grow further.</p></div></div></section><section class=portfolio-experience><div class=portfolio-section__header><p class=portfolio-section__eyebrow>Work</p><h2 class=portfolio-section__title>Projects and contributions</h2></div><div class=portfolio-experience__cards><v1-filter-in class=portfolio-experience__filter><div class="card portfolio-work-card" data-filter='{"complexity": "high", "Tech & Tools": ["Golang","BigQuery","PostgreSQL"] }'><span class="portfolio-work-card__badge complexity--high" title="high complexity">〣
