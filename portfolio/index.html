🔗</button></div><div class="portfolio-experience__description prose"><p>In an organization that heavily adopts Apache Kafka and event-driven architecture, Kafka events become a critical asset — enabling the development of various applications that react to real-time data.</p><p>However, not every developer wants or needs to interact with Kafka directly. To make Kafka more accessible and unlock its full potential across the organization, we built a platform called Firehose.</p><p>Firehose simplifies Kafka consumption by exposing events through a familiar interface: HTTP webhooks. Developers can use a self-serve UI to select the Kafka events they want to subscribe to, and Firehose will automatically deliver those events to their configured webhook endpoint. It also handles scaling, monitoring, and lifecycle management out of the box — all self-serve from the UI.</p><p>While Firehose empowers teams to consume events using their own logic, we also built Dagger — a no-code stream processing platform. With Dagger, developers can transform Kafka events using SQL, without writing or deploying custom application code. Dagger powers many critical systems, including supply-demand aggregation for surge pricing, fraud detection, and ad impression pipelines — all through declarative SQL, without the overhead of managing services.</p></div></div><div class=portfolio-experience__cards><v1-filter-in class=portfolio-experience__filter><div class="card portfolio-work-card" data-filter='{"complexity": "low", "Tech & Tools": ["Java","Apache Flink","Apache Kafka"] }'><span class="portfolio-work-card__badge complexity--low" title="low complexity">〡

🔗</button></div><div class="portfolio-experience__description prose"><p>Clickstream data is essential for marketing analytics and product development. However, collecting and managing this data presents several challenges. The ingestion system must be scalable to handle the high volume of user-generated events. It must also support flexible schemas to accommodate variations across event types. Additionally, the high frequency of incoming data requires careful selection of the communication protocol to ensure efficiency.</p><p>To address these challenges, we developed a clickstream ingestion platform called Raccoon.</p><p>Raccoon is a horizontally scalable, Go-based service that ingests clickstream data over the WebSocket protocol. It receives events from clients and routes them to Kafka topics for downstream processing. Built for scale and flexibility, Raccoon became the foundation for Gojek’s internal clickstream pipeline — enabling the company to replace a third-party SaaS solution that previously cost over $5 million USD annually.</p></div></div><div class=portfolio-experience__cards><v1-filter-in class=portfolio-experience__filter><div class="card portfolio-work-card" data-filter='{"complexity": "high", "Tech & Tools": ["Go","WebSocket","Apache Kafka"] }'><span class="portfolio-work-card__badge complexity--high" title="high complexity">〣

Traditionally, creating these segments requires marketers to identify data sources, write SQL queries, and manually execute them — a process that is tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming.</p><p>To remove this burden, we developed the Customer Segmentation Engine — a system that enables marketers to define segments declaratively based on customer properties and past behaviors, without writing SQL. Once defined, a segment can be executed to generate a list of customers who match the criteria. Segment definitions are reusable and can be saved for future campaigns, allowing marketers to focus on evaluation and optimization rather than data wrangling.</p><p>The engine accepts a segment definition in JSON format. When executed, it compiles the definition into SQL, runs the query, and prepares the result as downloadable CSV files. The engine supports complex logic including nested conditions, logical operators, time-based user behavior filters, and inclusion/exclusion rules.</p><p>This system has become a foundational tool for segmentation across the organization, saving hundreds of hours in manual effort and significantly accelerating campaign execution.</p></div></div><div class=portfolio-experience__cards><v1-filter-in class=portfolio-experience__filter><div class="card portfolio-work-card" data-filter='{"complexity": "high", "Tech & Tools": ["Golang","PostgreSQL","BigQuery"] }'><span class="portfolio-work-card__badge complexity--high" title="high complexity">〣
