When you focus on improvement, you invest. Your time is limited. Many times, you can only focus on one of them. Make sure you balance both and reconfigure your system from time to time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://rasyidhakim.com/thoughts/1751013149/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://rasyidhakim.com/thoughts/1751013149/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>I&amp;rsquo;ve always focused on building skills, believing that if I kept improving, career growth would naturally follow.&lt;/strong>
I learned that while skills and career advancement are correlated, they are not the same-and one doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically cause the other.
&lt;strong>Skill improvement is personal. Career advancement is social.&lt;/strong>
Advancing your career means leveling up within the value system of the community or organization you&amp;rsquo;re part of. It&amp;rsquo;s about understanding what your stakeholders need and delivering on that.
In other words, career growth depends less on how much you&amp;rsquo;ve improved, and more on how much value others perceive you bring-&lt;em>in their terms&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
