&lt;p&gt;When you work across multiple projects, your skills decay faster than your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept copy-pasting the same skills across repos and agent-specific directories. Each project slowly drifted. Small tweaks here, forgotten updates there. I never knew which version was the real one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem showed up quickly, so I fixed it at the root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution I landed on was simple: centralize skills and sync them across projects. I built a small CLI to support that workflow, with a single source of truth and on-demand updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Some Coding Agents Just Work</title><link>http://rasyidhakim.com/blog/why-some-coding-agents-just-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:35:49 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://rasyidhakim.com/blog/why-some-coding-agents-just-work/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, I’ve been working with coding agents for my development workflows, mainly Kilo Code and Codex. I came into Codex after spending significant time with Kilo, so the contrast was immediately noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kilo felt smooth out of the box. Codex felt more erratic. My first instinct was to judge the agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, the difference wasn’t model capability. It was defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kilo ships Distinct modes for different tasks (ask, architect, debug, code)
-Strong context and task scaffolding by default
-Built-in agent tools like a browser&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
