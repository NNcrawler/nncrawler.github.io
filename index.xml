Beneath the surface, every industry is a web of interconnected value chains, each shaped by geography and culture. What works in Jakarta doesn’t necessarily resonate in New York. What succeeds in New York might feel irrelevant in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re equipped with technical expertise, you understand how things work. That depth creates a bias toward selling the how of the building. Consultancies or agencies that trade on execution. But what kind of service you can offer, and how it’s perceived, depends on where you operate in the chain. The same skill can be indispensable in one context and invisible in another.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On Being a System Thinker</title><link>http://rasyidhakim.com/blog/on-being-a-systems-thinker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 13:13:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://rasyidhakim.com/blog/on-being-a-systems-thinker/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="index.svg" alt="System SVG"&gt;
I’ve always felt like I see the world a little differently. More like a system than a set of disconnected parts. I naturally think in terms of how things fit together. It’s hard for me to make sense of something without seeing the bigger picture first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably why I’ve never quite clicked with traditional education. Most of the time, you’re expected to start from the smallest details and build your way up. But I need the “why” before the “how.” Without context, the parts just don’t mean much to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
